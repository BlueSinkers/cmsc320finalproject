# Project Introduction
As a student at University of Maryland, I took a class called CMSC320 which teaches Data Science and Machine Learning, and as a result, I had to complete a data science project. This project specifically focuses on answering some questions pertinent to bike usage in the DMV (DC, MD, VA) region. To learn more, please read the jupyter notebook. To access the code on Colab, please go to this link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OjzbzpmwkE2ZWOCOEnRfTKLgFNXARA59?usp=sharing. Please also note this was a group project with various classmates in the class.
